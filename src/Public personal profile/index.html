        <p>My journey with secondary education started with my senior year in highschool when I started going part time to davis technical college to persue certification in IT. This was an excellent learning experience. Regretfully I was unable to finish the program due to constraints involving wanting to start college and the restricted time I had to participate due to extracurriculars and high school. <br> This is my third year of computer science at weber state and I'm hoping to graduate by my fourth year. I've alwasy had an interest in computer science since I was a kid trying to make games on my 3ds.</p>

        <p>Altough my career hasn't started, I've learned to find fulfillment and enjoyment in the jobs I've kept since the 10th grade. I love to cook in my free time, so it seemed natural to try to get a job in the food industry. For a 15 year old this meant working at Dairy Queen for 7.50 an hour. Eventually I changed to working at little ceasers while keeping sumemr jobs at Lagoon. <br> Finnally during my second year at college I decided to apply for a position at the hospital, and because of my personal interest in learning cooking I was able to get a job on the room service line at mckay dee hospital. I love this job because it gives me a chance to do what I love and help people in need. Although I haven't worked in computer science yet, I'm hoping to land an internship this summer. Wish me luck!</p>

        <p>In my personal life I spend time cooking, making and playing games, listening to music, and spending time with my amazing girlfriend! I'm interested in just about everything, my interest spanning philosophy, politics, buisness, organization, fasion, and even juggling sometimes.</p>
